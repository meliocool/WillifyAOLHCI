                    I was supposed to be sent away <br>
                    But they forgot to come and get me <br>
                    I was a functioning alcoholic<br>
                    'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic<br>
                    All of this to say I hope you're okay<br>
                    But you're the reason<br>
                    And no one here's to blame<br>
                    But what about your quiet treason?<br>
                    And for a fortnight there, we were forever<br>
                    Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather<br>
                    Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors<br>
                    Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her<br>
                    All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February<br>
                    I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary<br>
                    <br>
                    And I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
                    I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
                    I touched you for only a fortnight<br>
                    I touched you, but I touched you<br>
                    <br>
                    And for a fortnight there, we were forever<br>
                    Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather<br>
                    Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors<br>
                    Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her<br>
                    And for a fortnight there, we were together<br>
                    Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater<br>
                    Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors<br>
                    My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him<br>
                    <br>
                    I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
                    I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
                    I touched you for only a fortnight<br>
                    I touched you, I touched you<br>
                    I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
                    I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
                    I touched you for only a fortnight<br>
                    I touched you, I touched you<br>
                    <br>
                    Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up<br>
                    'Nother fortnight lost in America<br>
                    Move to Florida, buy the car you want<br>
                    But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me<br>

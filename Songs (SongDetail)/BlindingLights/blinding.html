                    Yeah<br>
                    <br>
                    I've been tryna call<br>
                    I've been on my own for long enough<br>
                    Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br>
                    I'm going through withdrawals<br>
                    You don't even have to do too much<br>
                    You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<br>
                    <br>
                    I look around and<br>
                    Sin City's cold and empty (oh)<br>
                    No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
                    I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
                    <br>
                    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
                    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
                    I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
                    Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
                    (Hey, hey, hey)<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm running out of time<br>
                    'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br>
                    So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh<br>
                    <br>
                    The city's cold and empty (oh)<br>
                    No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
                    I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
                    <br>
                    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
                    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
                    I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
                    Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)<br>
                    I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)<br>
                    Will never let you go this time (ooh)<br>
                    <br>
                    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
                    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
                    (Hey, hey, hey)<br>

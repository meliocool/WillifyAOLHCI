                    Long ago <br>
                    Just like the Hearse you die to get in again<br>
                    We are so far from you<br>
                    <br>
                    Burning on<br>
                    Just like the match you strike to incinerate<br>
                    The lives of everyone you know<br>
                    And what's the worst you take<br>
                    From every heart you break?<br>
                    And like the blade you'll stain<br>
                    Well, I've been holding on tonight<br>
                    <br>
                    What's the worst that I can say?<br>
                    Things are better if I stay<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    <br>
                    Came a time<br>
                    When every star fall<br>
                    Brought you to tears again<br>
                    We are the very hurt you sold <br>
                    And what's the worst you take<br>
                    From every heart you break?<br>
                    And like a blade you'll stain<br>
                    Well, I've been holding on tonight<br>
                    <br>
                    What's the worst that I can say?<br>
                    Things are better if I stay<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    Well, if you carry on this way<br>
                    Things are better if I stay<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    <br>
                    Can you hear me?<br>
                    Are you near me?<br>
                    Can we pretend to leave and then<br>
                    We'll meet again<br>
                    When both our cars collide<br>
                    <br>
                    What's the worst that I can say?<br>
                    Things are better if I stay<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    And if you carry on this way<br>
                    Things are better if I stay<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>
                    So long and goodnight<br>

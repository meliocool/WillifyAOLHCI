                    (Friends) <br>
                    Ooh <br>
                    <br>
                    You're in my head<br>
                    I had plans for the weekend (Ah)<br>
                    But wound up with you instead (Ah)<br>
                    Back here again (Oh)<br>
                    Got me deep in my feelings<br>
                    When I should be in your bed (Oh)<br>
                    <br>
                    You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever<br>
                    And you were there my lonely nights, yeah<br>
                    Keeping me together<br>
                    So wouldn't it make sense if I was yours?<br>
                    And you could call me your baby<br>
                    But we say we're just, say we're just<br>
                    <br>
                    Friends, just for now<br>
                    Yeah, but friends don't say words that<br>
                    Make friends feel like more than just<br>
                    Friends, just for now (Just for now)<br>
                    Now, I'm over pretending<br>
                    So let's put the "end" in friends<br>
                    <br>
                    Friends are not supposed to get too close<br>
                    And feel emotions that<br>
                    We're feeling now, now, now<br>
                    We ain't slowing down, down, down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
                    But once we cross the line<br>
                    There's no denying you and<br>
                    I can never turn around, 'round, 'round<br>
                    Know we'll never be the same (Ooh)<br>
                    <br>
                    You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever<br>
                    And you were there my lonely nights, yeah<br>

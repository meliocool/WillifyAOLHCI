                <p>
                    Some people think they're always right <br>
                    Others are quiet and uptight <br>
                    Others, they seem so very nice-nice-nice-nice, oh <br>
                    Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh, no<br>
                    Twenty-nine different attributes<br>
                    Only seven that you like, oh-oh<br>
                    Twenty ways to see the world, oh<br>
                    And twenty ways to start a fight, oh<br>
                    Oh don't, don't, don't get up<br>
                    I can't see the sunshine<br>
                    I'll be waiting for you, baby<br>
                    'Cause I'm through<br>
                    Sit me down<br>
                    Shut me up<br>
                    I'll calm down<br>
                    And I'll get along with you<br>
                    Oh, men don't notice what they got<br>
                    Oh, women think of that a lot<br>
                    One thousand ways to please your man, oh<br>
                    Not even one requires a plan, I know<br>
                    And countless odd religions too<br>
                    It doesn't matter which you choose, oh, no<br>
                    One stubborn way to turn your back, oh<br>
                    This I've tried and now refuse, oh<br>
                    Oh don't, don't, don't get up<br>
                    I can't see the sunshine<br>
                    Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby<br>
                    'Cause I'm through<br>
                    Sit me down<br>
                    Shut me up<br>
                    I'll calm down<br>
                    And I'll get along with you<br>
                    Alright<br>
                    Shut me up, shut me up<br>
                    And I'll get along with you<br>

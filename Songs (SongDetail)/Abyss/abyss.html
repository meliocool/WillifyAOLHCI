                    I've seen hell rise out of your eyes <br>
                    Creep up at night to your demise <br>
                    You've gotta fight, I've gotta fight <br>
                    Been thinkin' that I need isolation <br>
                    All this devastation <br>
                    Head needs renovation, alright <br>
                    If you had to choose, would you ever let me go? Ooh <br>
                    I can't stop the monster, I'm losin' my control, oh oh <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
                    'Cause I've gone cold <br>
                    Save my life <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
                    'Cause I've gone cold <br>
                    And I'm stuck in the abyss all on my own <br>
                    Save my life <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
                    Could someone please, save my life? <br>
